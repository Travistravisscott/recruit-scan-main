AI-Based Resume Screening System
ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Recruitment is one of the most resource-intensive processes in any organization.
HR teams often receive hundreds of resumes for a single role, making manual screening time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to bias.

The AI-Based Resume Screening System is designed to automate resume shortlisting using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).
It extracts key information from resumes, matches them against job descriptions, and provides a ranked list of candidates, saving recruiters valuable time.
